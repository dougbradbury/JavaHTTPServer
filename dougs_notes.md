#3 General notes
 * get rid of all commented code / tests
 * Looking at this as a whole, I am really impressed with the final design
 * I especially like how well seperated and compact each handler is
 * I still thing that using the same object for the request and response (RequestStore) is a bit confusing, but it's working for you, so you might be able to talk me into it.
 * Contratulations on some really great work!
